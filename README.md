# ExperiMoogs
Experiments with OpenFrameworks / Cinder.
This is a general Repo for my smaller prototypes and experiments. 
IF they grow big enough they might get their own. :)

## Requirements
Most of these require OpenFrameworks or cinder.
Any other specific requirements are listed in subfolders

### LINUX Notes:
Be sure to have at least **gcc 4.9** installed BEFORE you compile OF and the ProjectGenerator, otherwise the project generation will fail.

### Eigen (part of some of these)
Eigen is included as header files and should work as is and not require additional settings.
For optimizing for Visual Studio, see: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Visual_Studio
