Experiments with OpenFrameworks

## Requirements
To run, install openframeworks ( http://openframeworks.cc/download/ ) and run ProjectGenerator to generate project files and set the correct path.
It should auto-select ofxAssimpModelLoader and ofxGui in the projectgenerator, add them if they are not.

### LINUX Notes:
Be sure to have at least **gcc 4.9** installed BEFORE you compile OF and the ProjectGenerator, otherwise the project generation will fail.
